🛍️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales
A project completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program – OIBSIP
📅 Duration: July 2025 

📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail sales data to uncover hidden trends, patterns, and business insights that can help optimize sales strategies and customer targeting.

📂 Dataset Used
The dataset contains sales records with attributes like:
Order Date
Date
Comsumer ID
Gender
Age
PRoduct Category
Quantity
Price per Unit 
Total Amount

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Google Collab
Pandas – data wrangling & manipulation
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

🧠 Key Analysis Performed
✅ Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, duplicates, and ensured correct data types.
✅ Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation of key metrics.
✅ Sales Trend Analysis: Monthly/Yearly sales progression.
✅ Category-wise Sales & Profit: Identified top and underperforming categories.
✅ Geographical Insights: Region-wise sales and customer segmentation.
✅ Customer Behavior: Segment-wise performance and buying patterns.
✅ Profit vs Discount Analysis: Explored impact of discounting on profitability.
✅ Correlation Heatmap: Analyzed relationships between numerical features.

💡 Business Recommendations
Focus on top-selling categories (like Technology & Office Supplies) for higher ROI.
Improve performance in low-profit sub-categories by revising pricing or marketing.
Offer smarter discounts – heavy discounts often lead to reduced profitability.
Invest in regions with growing sales and explore underperforming regions.
Target high-value customer segments (e.g., Corporate) more strategically.
